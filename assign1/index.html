        <p>The W3C will continue to work on the HTML5 specification. WHATWG on the other hand will continue its work with HTML5 as a "Living Standard". The idea of a living standard is that it never settles down and is always being added to and refined.</p>
        <p>WHATWG sees the Web as an evolving, living platform; the W3C exists to formally recommend certain things. In practice, this means that it has been taking WHATWG its documents and changing them in ways that the WHATWG people do not always like.</p>

      <li>The first paragraph is preferred becouse the strong tag gives samantic meaning to the text. It reprecents the string impotance of it's contents. An other example would be the em and the i tags. The em tag reporesents stress emphasis of its contents, though the i tag does not.</li>
      <li>Both tags do not give samantic value to it's content. THey defer in thier default display porerty where, span in an inline element and div is a block element.</li>
      <li>The iframe encatulates the page inside and avoids javascript injections. You cannot communicate between the code inside the ifame and the code outside of it.</li>
