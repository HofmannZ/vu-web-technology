              <p>The word 'internationalization' means that everyone in this world should be able to access the internet with no constrains. This also means that the developer has to create a page where there are no writing boundaries: text from left to right, from right to left or mixed. Other languages spoken by small countries might be taken into consideration, because they can add new writing rules which should be tackled and not ignored. It’s the developer responsibility to make sure that all the W3C standards are respected, to make sure that the final web page is easily adapted by every user from a different country, culture or language. This is where the Unicode character set from W3C comes in handy, because it allows to a seamless integration of human language into Web technologies.</p>

              <h4>Most of the well-known HTTP web servers serve HTML and other content to end users. But behind the scenes, there are many HTTP servers that provide services for other web sites. To manage who is allowed to do what on these services, they often deploy <strong>keys</strong>: short sequences of characters that are used to uniquely identify you. We will use an example of such a web site in the assignments, for which your need a key. So please go the page at http://wt.ops.few.vu.nl/keys and generate a key. Please record the value of the key generated as the answer to this question, so you can use it later in the assignments.</h4>
