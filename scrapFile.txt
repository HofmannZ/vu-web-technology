1.Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives
2.Name of the website we have checked:"http://translate.google.com":
  a."The language of the document is not identified." This should be either specified as English or it should not because
  the website is international.
  b."Missing form label." The text label for the main text area is missing. This means that the screen reader application will have a problem to quide
    the disabled user to the main core function of the website: The ability to write text and get it translated.

4.Native application vs (responsive) Web application.
  a.Native application:
    -Advantage: have little overhead because the code is native, so the code runs buttery smooth.
    -Disadvantage: You have to know N programming languages if you develop your application on N phone platforms: Android, iOS, Windows Phone, etc.
  b.Web application:
    -Advantage: It takes less time to deploy an application because the code is written in JavaScript and JavaScript can run everywhere. As React-Native becomes more popular and powerful,
    it will be easier to write native applications using JavaScript.
    -Disadvantage: You need to write modules to have access to the phone's hardware. Those modules are built using native language. Until there are libraries for every phone feature,
    writing a web application for mobile will always have bottlenecks.
6.We have found the following IP addresses:
  -'few.vu.nl': '130.37.164.154'. Found using the bash command: 'host few.vu.nl'
  -'cs.vu.nl': '130.37.164.154'. Found using the bash command: 'host cs.vu.nl'
  Both have the same IP address. This could cause a load of trafic to this link and hence slow down the speed of the site.
