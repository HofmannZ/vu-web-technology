1.1.  Means that the request is stateless, if the request is the same the response is garanteed to be the same as well.

1.2.  You would only have to look a the timestamp to know if the data has changed. Else you can serve it right from the proxy.

1.3.  If an GET method is called you want to increment your amount of visitors. Therefore it's not RESTful.

1.4.  If the visitor counter, relies on the HTTP request reaching the server and updating a database, the proxy can't update the counter since it does not have access to the database.

2.    Because HTTP is stateless you can easly cache files because the response is garanteed to be the same if the request is.

3.    Cookies are used to keep certain data from the user accesible even if it sets up a new HTTP connection. This way you can store the IDs of the items in a user's cart and preserve them trough diferent sessions.

4.    The 303 error code means 'See Other' the requested page can be found under a different URL. the find this I used the W3C http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmessages.asp.

5.    Table:
Spotify:  https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/{id}                    GET   JSON
Twitter:  https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/user_timeline.json   GET   JSON

6.    Allowed methods are: POST, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE
      And you're allowed to acces it from anywhere.

7.    I would expect it to be JSON, and it actualy is JSON!

8.    You can see server has started, in the console. If you introduce a it will not compile and trow an error.

9.    Serving data in JSON format adds felxability to the developer, where you can choose how to to display the data yourself. Returning the data in HTML format removes the need to parse the javascript with imporves the parsing time, increses the time to terice the data.
