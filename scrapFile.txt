  b.Web application:
    -Advantage: It takes less time to deploy an application because the code is written in JavaScript and JavaScript can run everywhere. As React-Native becomes more popular and powerful,
    it will be easier to write native applications using JavaScript.
    -Disadvantage: You need to write modules to have access to the phone's hardware. Those modules are built using native language. Until there are libraries for every phone feature,
